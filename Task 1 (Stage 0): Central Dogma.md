# Central Dogma in Molecular Biology üß¨
## Introduction
‚ÄúWhat does the synthesis of proteins in the body and the baking of bread have in common?‚Äù is a question one might find strange.
However, this question is not any more strange than the commonality in both processes‚Äîthe order in which bread and proteins are made.
The synthesis of protein much like the baking of bread is unidirectional (in one direction, from one end to the other).
A baker does not bake bread before creating his recipe, just as the protein is not translated from the RNA before the RNA is transcribed from the DNA.
This order of processes observed at the molecular level of nucleic acids and protein is considered the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology; a phenomenon first articulated by Francis Crick in 1958 (Ostrander, n.d.).
## Understanding Genetic Information Flow
The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology describes the process by which genetic information flows from the DNA to RNA, and then to Proteins. 
An organism‚Äôs phenotype which is influenced by environmental factors, is determined by this flow of genetic information (Kukurba and Montgomery, 2015). What makes it a central dogma is the fact that genetic information almost never flows backward from protein to DNA. 
‚ÄúAlmost‚Äù because there are exceptions, like in the case of Prions‚Äîinfectious proteins capable of replication without going through DNA or RNA intermediates and are responsible for some of the most destructive neurological diseases (Ostrander, n.d.), and reverse transcription‚Äîwhere RNA is reverse transcribed into DNA (process used by HIV and other retroviruses).
Regardless of these exceptions, understanding the conventional unidirectional flow of genetic information is important in grasping the mechanisms of genetic expression, regulation, and the molecular basis of diseases.  

  
Going back to where we started from, that is, the bakery, we can find parallels between the processes in a bakery, and the molecular processes in a cell. The master recipe book acts as the DNA which is kept safe in the cabinet, just like the DNA is kept safe in the nucleus. The baker makes a recipe copy on a note card which acts like the messenger RNA (mRNA) to create the cake (protein) in the kitchen (cytoplasm). The DNA is the blueprint of life‚Äîthe molecule that carries the genetic instructions of all known organisms; DNA is then transcribed to RNA (specifically mRNA)‚Äîthe transient copy of the genetic code which carries the information needed to build proteins from the nucleus; Protein is then translated from mRNA‚Äîthe last step that occurs in the cytoplasm.
## Conclusion
In conclusion, the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology is crucial in understanding how DNA is translated into functional proteins. This knowledge is vital to advancements in biotechnology, medicine, and genetics, allowing for innovations like gene therapy and personalized medicine (Kukurba & Montgomery, 2015).

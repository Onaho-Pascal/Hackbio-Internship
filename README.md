## Stage 0
### Task Overview
In this task, we visualized and analyzed a gene expression dataset by generating heatmaps with various clustering methods and color schemes to interpret expression patterns. We identified significantly up- and downregulated genes, performed functional enrichment analysis using tools like ShinyGO, GOrilla, or PANTHER, and visualized the top 10 pathways with a plot reflecting gene counts and pathway significance. The top 3 enriched biological pathways were also described in detail.
## Stage 1
### Task Overview
Engaged in a comprehensive literature review, critically analyzing existing research relevant to bioinformatics. This stage emphasized understanding the current state of knowledge, identifying research gaps, and formulating questions that will guide subsequent stages of the internship.
## Stage 2
### Task Overview
In this stage, interns applied their coding skills to analyze biological data and created meaningful visualizations. They worked with programming languages like Python and R, generating graphs, charts, and other visual aids that effectively communicated data-driven insights.
## Stage 3
### Task Overview
We identified potential cancer biomarkers from a TCGA dataset through differential expression and machine learning. Steps included data preprocessing, differential expression and functional enrichment analyses, feature selection, and classification using kNN or random forest. The comprehensive report covered cancer background, data methodology, biomarker findings, model performance, visualizations, and research recommendations.
## Stage 4
### Task Overview
We reproduced unsupervised clustering of gliomas (516 LGG) based on methylation levels to classify six IDH statuses using kNN. The task involved dataset preprocessing, feature selection, and normalization, followed by kNN and random forest classification. A report covered glioma background, dataset and methodology, kNN results with visualizations, and insights comparing our findings with the target paper.
## Stage 5 - 7
### Task Overview
In the final stages of the internship, participants undertook a comprehensive project that integrated the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the program. This project involved identifying a research question, designing a bioinformatics approach, and presenting the findings. These stages simulated a real-world research experience, effectively preparing interns for professional roles in bioinformatics.

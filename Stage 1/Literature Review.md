## Scope and Relevance of the Work
  Globally, lung cancer management has remained a major concern due to the rapid heterogeneity of diagnosis and therapy attributed to the enormous amount of data produced by advanced imaging and sequencing technologies. This paper seeks to tackle this challenge by laying emphasis on the significance and utilization of machine learning (ML) in managing, integrating, and analyzing these big datasets that have become a setback in oncology. It primarily indicates the areas where ML can be applied in lung cancer, including early detection, diagnostics, prognostics, and treatment (immunotherapy).   
  
  The research focused on deep learning methods, particularly the convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have become prevalent in structuring imaging data. It discussed how CNNs are applicable in detecting nodules, feature extraction, and representing 3D models for diagnosing lung cancer. The findings are well-supported by evidence from various datasets and methods, though it relays existing research rather than presenting new experimental data.
   ## Challenges Discussed
The Authors highlighted that there is difficulty in combining imaging, omics, and clinical data due to platform noise and batch effects. They also mentioned the need for explainable AI (XAI) to clarify deep learning models, and lastly, the problem of Generalizability; Li et al. (2022) mentioned that there could be inconsistent performance across methods used to handle large data sets multiple times, while suggesting that robustness of these ML methods be improved.  
The authors also noted limitations, highlighting that these algorithms are not universally applicable. Dataset characteristics, including feature selection and gene types, vary significantly between studies, potentially impacting the accuracy and generalizability of results.
## Conclusion
In conclusion, the authors tell its readers that in order to effectively diagnose, treat, and prevent a disease like lung cancer, large datasets from existing and developing imaging and sequencing techniques would need to be obtained. However, the data required is often so large that it would be impractical to use conventional methods for analyzing these datasets, and machine learning, instead, can go a long way in doing this job. They do this by reviewing several Machine Learning methods used in handling large datasets for the diagnosis, treatment, prognostics, and prevention of Lung Cancer.
